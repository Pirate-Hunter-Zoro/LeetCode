# My GoLang LeetCode Solutions
All of this code is my own, including the various data structures and algorithms that were useful in solving different problems.<br> 
However, I often took inspiration from discussion posts online, or from the question editorial and hints. Sometimes when said discussions hinted at an algorithm I did not know, I would learn the algorithm from a YouTube video or GeeksForGreeks article and cite the source.<br>
I made sure to cite each source that I used in the docstrings of each method!
