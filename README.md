# My GoLang LeetCode Solutions
All of this code is my own, including the various data structures and algorithms that were useful in solving different problems.<br> 
However, I often took inspiration from discussion posts online, or from the question editorial and hints. Sometimes when said discussions hinted at an algorithm I did not know, I would learn the algorithm from a YouTube video or GeeksForGreeks article and cite the source.<br>
I made sure to cite each source that I used in the docstrings of each method!

# Pleas for Help
Sometimes, I have implemented code that I simply cannot see the error in, which means I need another set of eyes.<br>
My please for that help I will document here!<br>

## `minimumCost`
Currently, my solution for `minimumCost` does not work when you submit it on LeetCode, and I would be hardpressed as to say why. I cannot tell the difference between my implementation and the LeetCode editorial's implementation. For anyone who can offer me some wisdom on that matter, I would love it if you could contact me and let me know what to fix!
